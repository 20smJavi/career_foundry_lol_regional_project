# career_foundry_lol_regional_project
> This project was for the Career Foundry 'Data Immersion' course where I was tasked with locating open sourced data with regional information to perform an analysis on. More about the guidelines to this project is located in '01 Project Management\\Data Immersion A6 Project Brief.pdf' that details the requirements for this project. You might also see the 'Achievement 6 Project Portfolio.pdf' that details information about the open source data in how it was collected and potential issues.

> I chose to do this project as I have played League of Legends since Season Three which started in February 1st, 2013. I have a lot of knowledge of the game and would hope to one day work as an analyst in the video game industry whether it be working with developers or working in Esports. This project to me gives me the experience of working in the industry I would like to grow into.
